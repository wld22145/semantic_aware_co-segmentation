NOTICE
This project is unfinished, so it has only partial functions.
This project is only used by me, so it has very messy layout.

This project is based on https://github.com/sairin1202/Semantic-Aware-Attention-Based-Deep-Object-Co-segmentation 

There are corresponding paper, codes and instructions.

1.Install:

follow the instruction at the github link.

NOTICE
actually the code requires more packages than that, and some packages are never used. 


but I still keep those import code

2.Train:

to train a model you need to :

download the dataset from the github link.

unzip the dataset into Datasets folder with name PascalVoc.

follow the instruction at the link.

Because I modified the defualt address so directly using " python train.py " can also work.

Unless the defualt address doesn't suit you.

NOTICE
I set the defualt batch_size as 16, and it may consume 32G memory

if there is out-of-memory error, set the batch_szie to 4


3.Use:

to use a model you need to:

there must be a model existing in the model_path folder

if there isn't, then train one or download one

you can download the author's model from the github link, or mine from

then follow the instruction at the link


4.Evaluate:

to evaluate a model with 3 metrics you need to:

NOTICE
This part is mixed in train.py and very messy now


you need to modify the end of train.py

trainer = Trainer('train')

to

trainer = Trainer('test')

input a filename the test() function

and then call trainer.test()

I will clean it up soon

5.Results:

in the demo folder, I already placed two extra images generated by my model.

in the group_demo folder, I already placed an extra folder of images generated by my model.

in the logs model, I placed many log information files generated when training. There are time consumption and evaluation information. But They are not very uniform.


6.Models

By defualt the train.py uses model_ca.py, that is, a model with CA attention learner.

I implement CSA, FCA too.

To a train model with them you need to:

modify the train.py

set 

self.mode

to a proper name, which determines your model's name when you save it

set 

self.net = model_ca.model().cuda()

to

self.net = model_csa.model().cuda()

or something like it to use CSA or other models

I implement FCSA, which is a new fusion method I created.

I implement a new model structure based on inception_v3 model but it fails completely. This model is at model_inception_fail.py
